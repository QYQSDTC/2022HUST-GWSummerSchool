July 20-23rd

1) Overview: Stochastic gravitational-wave background searches and sources

Provide an overview of searches for stochastic GW backgrounds across the
electromagnetic spectrum.  Introduce different types of stochastic backgrounds,
different types of detectors used to detect it, and give current status of
those searches.

2) Bayesian inference / data analysis

Compare and contrast Bayesian and frequentist statistics.  Define relevant
quantities such as frequentist 90% CL upper limits, hypothesis testing,
Bayesian credible intervals and model selection.

3) Cross-correlation methods and overlap reduction functions

Introduce the concept of cross corelation using data from multiple detectors as
a robust method to search for stochastic GWs.  Define the overlap reduction
function as the correlation coefficient relating GW strain power and the
cross-correlated power in a pair of detectors.  Give examples for ground-based
interferometers and pulsar timing arrays.

4) A worked example: Pulsar timing array searches for an isotropic GWB

Apply concepts from the previous lectures to analyze simulated data relevant
for pulsar timing array searches for GW backgrounds.  Describe an acoustic
analogue of pulsar timing arrays using metronomes and a microphone.
