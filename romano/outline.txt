July 20-23rd

1) Frequentist statistics and Bayesian inference 

Compare and contrast frequentist statistics and Bayesian inference.  Define
relevant quantities such as frequentist 90% confidence intervals, hypothesis
testing, Bayesian credible intervals and model selection.

2) Overview of stochastic GW background searches and sources

Provide an overview of searches for stochastic GW backgrounds across the GW
spectrum.  Introduce different types of stochastic backgrounds, different types
of detectors used to detect these backgrounds, and give current status of those
searches.

3) Cross-correlation methods and overlap reduction functions

Introduce the concept of cross corelation using data from multiple detectors as
a robust method to search for stochastic GWs.  Define the overlap reduction
function as the correlation coefficient relating GW strain power and the
cross-correlated power in a pair of detectors.  Give examples for ground-based
interferometers and pulsar timing arrays.

4) Case study: The NANOGrav 12.5-year analysis for an isotropic stochastic
GW background

Apply concepts from the previous lectures to discuss pulsar timing array
searches for GW backgrounds, focusing on the recent NANOGrav 12.5-yr analysis
for an isotropic GWB produced by inspiraling super-massive black-hole binaries
in the centers of merging galaxies.
